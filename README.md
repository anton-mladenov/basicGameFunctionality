Notes:

- First thing first, I commented out the tests.js file in the HTML file of the game cause it was causing the pop-ups to be popped-up prematurely.

- as I was developing the game I had many questions to ask and lots of comments to give. However, as I was progressing I realized many, many different things which now need no explanation. 

- At the beginning I used an image of an Irish inn, hence the name of the game. The image is no longer the same but the name remained.

- When I finished and gave the game to a human (my roommate) I realized that you can play against more than one enemy. But then the health of the hero could become less than 0. :D

- That's another thing, actually. I decided to add two enemies more with different weapons and weapon damage.

- Believe it or not, the most time spent on a single function was when I worked on the equipWeapon function. Also, here's the biggest lesson learnt - if something that seems relatively simple at the beginning starts taking you more time and more complicated code than you might expect, then most like the problem is indeed simple and not a hard one. Then, it's time for taking a step back and refactoring back to simplicity. On that function, I StackOverflow-ed ways to extract parameters and items from objects and arrays nested in each other. Crazy!

- I hope you will enjoy it!
